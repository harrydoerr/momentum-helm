# Typescript

## Learning Objectives

1. Know how to make a typescript file
2. Compile it to javascript
3. Install types for a package

## Setup

1. [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Getting Started

1. What problems does Typescript solve?
1. Create a new project directory
1. Install TSC
1. Strict mode
1. Declaring variables
1. Look at problems TypeScript solves, like closures.
1. Base types: number, string, boolean
1. Functions - why are there so many syntaxes?
    - [arrow functions vs functions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/when-and-why-you-should-use-es6-arrow-functions-and-when-you-shouldnt-3d851d7f0b26/)

## Exercise

1. Build [Fizz-buzz](https://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest) in Typescript. _Note: I object to some of the language on this page casting shade on programmers who struggle with this exercise._
1. return the largest element of a list
1. write a program to add two numbers in the browser, compile to javascript, and paste into the console. What errors did you get?
    - what if you wanted it to run in Node?
    - you could use the [readline](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) Library
    - yuck?

## Classes, Types, and more

1. Async/Await
1. Objects
1. Spread operator
1. Template strings
1. Rest parameters
1. Optional vs Nullable - overrides
1. Still null vs undefined
1. Types are still "duck-typed". See: "PointLike example"
1. Record<Keys,Type>
1. For .. of
1. Generics
1. Classes
1. Utility Types: `Partial`, `Required`, `Readonly`, `Pick`, `Omit`
1. Modules and export

## Exercise II

1. Write a function that concatenates two lists
1. Write an object that holds the information about you from your webpage including types.
1. Write a function to find which entries of a list are numbers and return them.

## What about the browser?

1. Browser APIs
1. innerText
